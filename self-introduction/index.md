## Hello, my name is Veronica. 
I graduated from BIP - Law University, and in my final year of university I moved to work in the banking sector, and then almost 4 years later, I went on maternity leave. 
Maternity leave is a pretty monotonous period. And I am comfortable constantly learning and moving forward. So, exactly a year ago, I came to the idea of coding. 
I studied the recommendations of youtube bloggers, chose to learn Python, then for 5 months I studied this language on the online platform Stepic along with the subject of statistical analysis. Step by step I immersed myself in coding and it became my hobby. 
Closer to summer, I was already seriously thinking about changing the banking sector to the IT sector. I took a career guidance test on the EPAM website, the result was unambiguous - frontend development, so from June last year I got into RSSCHOOL courses. 
I successfully completed stage 0 and started stage 1 with even more desire. In the process of learning I faced various difficulties, the material seemed quite difficult, but a great desire, other students and Google helped me. So, day by day, coding gradually became my passion. 
In the process of working on learning projects, I have determined for myself what works best and what requires extra effort. Thus, I am good at realizing the clear terms of the technical assignment, but I still have difficulties in creative tasks. With each new training project I try to introduce and practice new knowledge, make my code cleaner and more readable. 
I want to say a few words about my level of English. At school I was lucky enough to learn German, which over time I forgot. The level of English is still insufficient, so I prepared my speech with the help of an Internet resource, but I am gradually moving in this direction and am guided by the principle “the road will take one who walks”.
