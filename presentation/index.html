        <h2>The Development of Programming Languages</h2>
        <p style="margin-top: 40px; text-align: justify; font-size: 35px; color: rgb(111 109 100);">
          Programming languages have evolved dramatically over the past decades, from the early low-level machine
          languages to the high-level, human-readable languages we use today. This journey has transformed how we write,
          understand, and interact with code.

          <h3 style="color: #ef983a;">Machine Language</h3>
          <p style="margin-top: 40px; text-align: justify; font-size: 35px; color: rgb(111 109 100);">
            The earliest programming languages were machine languages, which used binary codes to directly control the
            computer's hardware.

          <p style="margin-top: 40px; text-align: justify; font-size: 35px; color: rgb(111 109 100);">
            Assembly language was a significant step forward from machine language. It introduced symbolic codes that
            replaced the binary instructions, making it easier for humans to read and write programs. Assembly language
            is still tied to the underlying hardware, as it uses mnemonics to represent machine instructions, but it is
            more abstract than machine language.

          <p style="margin-top: 40px; text-align: justify; font-size: 35px; color: rgb(111 109 100);">
            Fortran (FORmula TRANslation) is one of the earliest high-level programming languages. It was developed in
            the 1950s by IBM for scientific and engineering applications. Fortran was revolutionary because it allowed
            programmers to write instructions in a more human-readable form, using mathematical expressions, rather than
            having to use the binary machine language.

            High-level languages were a significant development in the history of programming languages. They were
            designed to be more human-readable and easier to use than low-level languages like machine code or assembly
            language. High-level languages allow programmers to write code using more abstract concepts and syntax that
            closely resembles human language, which makes the code easier to understand and maintain. Some of the first
            high-level languages include: </p>

            Created in the late 1950s, LISP is a language primarily used for artificial intelligence (AI) and symbolic
            computation. It introduced many concepts that are now common in programming, such as recursion and dynamic
            typing.

            Object-oriented programming (OOP) emerged as a significant paradigm shift in the world of programming in the
            late 20th century. This programming model was designed to make software development more efficient and
            manageable by organizing code into reusable and modular components called objects.
