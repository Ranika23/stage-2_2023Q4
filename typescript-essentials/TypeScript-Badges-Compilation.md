## Reflections

| MODULE | REFLECTIONS |
| ------ | ------ |
| [Get started with TypeScript](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/typescript-get-started/) | I've identified key differences between TypeScript and JavaScript, one of which is the type system, which allows you to better navigate the purpose of your code. For example, in TypeScript, you can determine the data type of a variable or parameter using the type hint . Another advantage of TypeScript is static type checking, which allows me to identify code problems early in the development process. I also learned how to customize a TypeScript project in Visual Studio Code. |
| [Declare Variable Types in TypeScript](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/typescript-declare-variable-types/) | I highlighted the advantages of declaring typed variables in TypeScript, learned to declare variables using primitive types(boolean , number, string, enum, void types), object types(class, interface, array, literals types), union and intersection types, noted the specifics of using null and undefined types. I also noted the improvement of code readability criterion when using explicit type annotations. |
| [Implement Interfaces in TypeScript](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/typescript-implement-interfaces/) | Familiarized myself with the concept of an interface, its main task, which is to describe a type. Also noted the cases in which the use of interfaces will be reasonable and useful, for example, for frequently used types or in the case of command work, when the objects implementing the interface must implement all the necessary members of the interface. In addition, interfaces will be useful in working with libraries by specifying fixed parameters for functions. In the module, I also noted the differences between interfaces and type aliases, which include the ability to extend an interface and the inability of a type alias to describe anything other than a union or tuple. I also practiced extending interfaces, declaring and creating an interface instance, and familiarized myself with other ways of using interfaces (in cases of creating indexed types, describing API) |
| [Develop Typed Functions in TypeScript](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/typescript-develop-typed-functions/) | In this module, I noted the advantages of using types in functions, which include checking the condition for the correctness of the type of the passed and returned value, regulating the number of mandatory and optional parameters. I practiced writing functions with mandatory and optional parameters, default parameters and their application in work. I also got acquainted with the syntax of rest parameters, which are convenient to use in work with an indefinite number of parameters, and the syntax of deconstructive parameters of an object, which implies the use of an interface for defining named parameters in functions. I learned how to define function types using type aliases or interfaces, and got acquainted with the syntax of type signature. |
| [Declare and Instantiate Classes in TypeScript](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/typescript-declare-instantiate-classes/1-introduction) | Learned the specifics of using classes in TypeScript, including type annotation for class members and the ability to specify mandatory or optional parameters. I practiced declaring a class and creating an instance of it using TypeScript. Noted the specificity of defining properties, constructor, accessors, and methods, given the use of access modifiers such as public, private, and protected. Learned the syntax of extending a class using inheritance. Also familiarized myself with the ability to declare an interface to provide the form of a class through the linking keyword - implements. In addition, noted for myself the key emphases for choosing a more convenient form of defining the structure of objects - classes or interfaces. For example, interfaces are weightless, do not take up space in the resulting file and do not adversely affect the code to be executed. Classes, in turn, allow you to define implementation details: methods, fields, and properties. |
| [Generics in TypeScript](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/typescript-generics/) | Discovered a completely new syntax for passing to functions, classes or interfaces, information about what type to use when calling them. I noticed the key feature of Generics - universality, which gives more flexibility when working with types, allows you to reuse code, reducing the need to use any type. Practiced implementing generics with interfaces, functions, and classes. The logic of Generics seemed simple enough to me, but the syntax was difficult to memorize, I noted for myself the need for additional practice to master it. I believe that in real projects Generics is certainly a useful addition to make the code more concise and readable. |
| [Work with External Libraries in TypeScript](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/typescript-work-external-libraries/) | I noted for myself the similarities in the organization of code in JavaScript and TypeScript using external modules, including the possibility of exporting and importing any declaration using the keywords export and import, got acquainted with the mechanism of compiling modules. I also focused on the specifics of importing third-party libraries, such as the need to install the node type definition due to TypeScript's static typing and its absence in some part of the list of third-party libraries. I believe that code organization in a real project is, first of all, a key necessity, the implementation of which helps to make the work on the project more productive and less costly. |
