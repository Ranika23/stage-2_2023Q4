## Reflections

| MODULE | REFLECTIONS |
| ------ | ------ |
| [Get started with TypeScript](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/typescript-get-started/) | I've identified key differences between TypeScript and JavaScript, one of which is the type system, which allows you to better navigate the purpose of your code. For example, in TypeScript, you can determine the data type of a variable or parameter using the type hint . Another advantage of TypeScript is static type checking, which allows me to identify code problems early in the development process. I also learned how to customize a TypeScript project in Visual Studio Code. |
| [Declare Variable Types in TypeScript](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/typescript-declare-variable-types/) | I highlighted the advantages of declaring typed variables in TypeScript, learned to declare variables using primitive types(boolean , number, string, enum, void types), object types(class, interface, array, literals types), union and intersection types, noted the specifics of using null and undefined types. I also noted the improvement of code readability criterion when using explicit type annotations. |
