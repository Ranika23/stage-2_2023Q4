## Reflections

| MODULE | REFLECTIONS |
| ------ | ------ |
| [Get started with TypeScript](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/typescript-get-started/) | I identified for myself the key differences between TypeScript and JavaScript, one of which is the type system. For example, in TypeScript you can determine the data type of a variable or parameter by using the type hint . I also learned how to customize a TypeScript project in Visual Studio Code. |
